**Amazon ec2 not working when accessing through public IP :**
Refere link : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26818456/amazon-ec2-not-working-when-accessing-through-public-ip
-> create security group with request you are wish to grant access. here I've created security group to any request
-> set inbound with all traffic -> anywhere
-> Then add the specific security group to network interface

**Install apache2 :**
Let’s first update ubuntu server by executing the command
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

Now, we can install apache as easy as typing the command
	sudo apt-get install apache2
	
NB. Check if apache is working fine by visiting the public IP address of your EC2 instance. In case everything is OK, you should see the famous apache index page.

**Install MySQL :**
Now, let’s jump to MySQL installation by executing the commands
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server
	sudo mysql_secure_installation
	
	 You will be prompted to several screens let’s address them one by one
		- Activate the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN: select No (no need for a validation now but you need of course to choose a strong memorizable password next step)
		- Choose a root password and confirm it again.
		- You might need to remove anonymous users, and temporarily allow root login remotely (after your web app database migration, you can reconfigure mysql to only allow root@’your host here’).
		- Disable test databases access, and reload privilege tables.
		
	Now after finishing installation you can check if MySQL works fine by logging to your database using the command. You will be prompted to MySQL command screen.
		sudo mysql -u root -p

**Install PHP: **
	
	install PHP7.4 
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php

	sudo apt install php7.4

	sudo apt install php7.4-common php7.4-cli php7.4-bcmath php7.4-bz2 php7.4-curl php7.4-gd php7.4-intl php7.4-json php7.4-mbstring php7.4-readline php7.4-xml php7.4-zip php7.4-fpm

	sudo a2dismod php7.3
	sudo a2enmod php7.4
	sudo service apache2 restart


	- To install PHP and some other most commonly needed modules, we will use again apt-get and executing the command below
		sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php
		# necessary modules for PHP server
		sudo apt-get install php-mysql php-curl php-gd php-json php-zip php-mbstring php-mcrypt
	- We need to restart apache to get last system changes
		sudo service apache2 restart
	- To check if PHP is installed successfully, go to /var/www/html folder and create your first php script there by creating a PHP file (index.php already created by apache. Feel free to remove it or modify it) and copy past the code below in it
		<?php
		   phpinfo();
		?>
		After visiting the link [x.x.x.x/index.php] (x.x.x.x public IP address of your EC2 instance), you will see this page

**Install phpMyAdmin :**
	- phpMyAdmin facilitate accessing and managing your MySQL database via a web page. To install it you need to execute the comma	nd below

			sudo mysql -u root -p
		- Change root login to password type by executing the command
			ALTER USER `myroot`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'CM@MalayaliMatri@2021';
		- Apply changes by executing the command
			FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

---------- **Enable Email service** ------------

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19559063/simple-php-mail-function-not-working-on-amazon-server-ec2

Solution worked for me:

install sendmail by command:

 sudo apt-get install sendmail
check the service whether its started or not by execuring follwing command

service sendmail status
Note: Output of above command should be something - 'Active: active (running)'

start the service if it is not running by following command

service sendmail start
After the service is started, send a test mail using following command:

echo "This is test mail body" | mail -s "Test Mail Subject" "sabir@narjisinfotech.com"
Replace email with your email ID and see if you receive this email, if yes, then your mail setup is fine and now your php email should be working fine.

If not, file to check for errors is /var/spool/mail/.
